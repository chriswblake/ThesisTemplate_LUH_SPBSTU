Students at the end of a master's degree program must produce a document outlining and describing the full details of a project. The university requires documentation for such projects to relatively similar and thus follow the same formatting rules. Additionally all such papers are expected to have certain content. A template with the correct requirements will aid students in this goal, producing professional quality documents and saving time.
