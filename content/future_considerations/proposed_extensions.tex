\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Algorithms} - SPBPU requires algorithms to be displayed as figures. Normally algorithms are displayed via the algorithm enviornment. A new environment could be created for changing the location of the figure name and number automatically as well as placing the content in a box.
    
    \item \textbf{Equations} - SPBPU requires equations to be formatted as the end of a sentance with commas and a period. A new enviornment could be created with an option to turn these commas and period on/off. This would enable all this format to be adjust from the template, rather than in the content itself.
\end{enumerate}
