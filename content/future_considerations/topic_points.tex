\label{sec:topic_points}
It is very likely that the new thesis will solve all problems and have no room for development or improvements. As such, these ideas should be documented and briefly introduced here to encourage others to build upon the new work described in the thesis. The formatting here is only for example.

Below is a list of topics that became apparent during development and testing of this work. They are not meant to be extensive, but rather to provide insight about any future developments. Entries in \textbf{bold} have proposed extensions in section~\ref{sec:proposed_extensions}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Algorithms} – SPBPU requires algorithms to be figures and generally other scientific writers prefer the algorithmic format. This is not part of the automatic formatting.
    \item \textbf{Equations} – SPBPU requires equations to be the end of a sentence and be seperated by commas. LUH does not have this requirement. This is not part of the automatic formatting.
\end{enumerate}
