An adaptive template has been created for semi-automating the formatting of a master thesis. This LaTeX template serves to create two versions, one for Leibniz University Hannover and one for Peter the Great Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University.

A main.tex file is created for both universities, which defines the standard formatting rules for each university and then references various content files with minimal formatting. When compiled two seperated documents are produced from the same content.
