An adaptive template has been created for semi-automating the formatting of a master thesis. This LaTeX template serves to create two versions, one for Leibniz University Hannover and one for Peter the Great Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University. A user must only produce the content pages and define the structure in a main file and that same content will be used in both thesis reports.
